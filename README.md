# Neural Circuit Dynamics Under Stress â€“ mPFC Network Simulation

This notebook demonstrates a simplified **computational model of medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) circuit dynamics** under **baseline vs. chronic-stress-like perturbations**, aligned with the research focus of **LabontÃ© Lab** and **Dynamica Research Lab (UniversitÃ© Laval)**.

### ðŸŽ¯ Objective
To simulate how **stress alters temporal neuronal population dynamics** and **network state transitions** in a recurrent microcircuit. This model demonstrates:
- Temporally evolving population states (`activity trajectories`)
- State transition logic relevant to motivated and emotional behavior
- Perturbation of synaptic weights under chronic stress
- Dimensionality reduction (PCA) for neural representation space
- Network connectivity visualization and circuit motifs
